      content="Recent CS graduate with hands on experience in developing both front end and back end. Striving to be better fullstack engineer every day. Aside from developing web apps, I m interested in Algorithms for Big Data: Dictionary Problems (Hashing with chaining, FKS, Cuckoo, Bloom Filters), Streaming Algorithms (Morris Counters, AMS Sampling, Count Min Sketch, Hyperloglog), and Online Algorithms (Caching, Weighted Majority, Splay Trees).
      Aside from algorithms, I am aspiring full stack software engineer. I do my best to write fully testable, reusable, and clean code. I enjoy writing Javascript for both my front end (React) and back end in Node. I m a big fan of microservice architecture and I love architecting my app beforehand. I love working with relational databases; applying normalization theory to avoid redundancy while designing my tables. I like implementing caching mechanisms usually through Redis that helps create faster and scalable web apps."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
