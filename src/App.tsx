  shortDescription: "A web application that JS developers preparing for coding interviews can use to level up their JavaScript skills by solving daily coding challenge problems.",
  description: "Built a remote JS code executor micro service built using Node.js and Docker that can run various test cases in parallel and in isolation and returns the correctness and running time of userâ€™s code. Integrated Nginx as API gateway that intercepts users requests and pass it to reliable micro services that might be running in different VM instances depending on payload of the requests. Implemented User Authentication features using JWT in such a way that each microservices can independently authenticate userâ€™s requests without even having to query database. Implemented Bloom Filters using Redis in order to massively speed up the process of checking for available usernames and email during user registration process. Wrote my own simple ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that can generate postgres queries and run them which accelerated my development process by a lot. Wrote entire frontend with solid UI/UX design fundamentals in mind using React.js.",

  title: "Image Processing",
    languages: ["java", "c++"],

  shortDescription: "Implemented various steps in digital image processing ranging from thresholding, noise filtering, and  image enhancement using various filters and masks. ",
  description: "Image Processing is the low level computer vision where processing unit is 'pixel to pixel'. Here various algorithms might be used to process an image. Usually the first step in image processing is conditioning. While doing conditioning, original image is scanned in order to remove noise and maybe even for smoothing purposes. This step is vital since later steps in Computer Vision depends highly on quality of processed image.  ",

    title: "Low/Mid Level Computer Vision",
    languages: ["java", "c++"],
    shortDescription: "Implemented various algorithms that could be a part of low and mid level CV. Various morphological operations like dilution, erosion, opening, and closing using various structuring elements. Also implemented 4 connectedness and 8 connectedness algorithms to group objects in an image and extracting properties of each objects into a property File.",
    description: "Based on low-level image processing, low-level vision tasks could be preformed, such as image matching, optical flow computation and motion analysis. Image matching basically is to find correspondences between two or more images. These images could be the same scene taken from different view points, or a moving scene taken by a fixed camera, or both. Constructing image correspondences is a fundamentally important problem in vision for both geometry recovery and motion recovery. Without exaggeration, image matching is part of the base for vision  ",

    title: "Image Compression",
    languages: ["java", "c++"],

    shortDescription: "Implemented various algorithms that can compress image in lossless manner. Some of the techniques used for the compression are: Run length encoding, distance transform, thinning, chain code. ",
    description: "Lossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates (and therefore reduced media sizes). ",

    description: "Kubernetes (also known as k8s is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. There are many way to configure K8 clusters in cloud environment. There is even ready made k8 environments set up by AWS (EKS) and GCP (K8 engine) which makes our life lot easier as cloud developers.",

    description: "Apache Spark has its architectural foundation in the resilient distributed dataset (RDD), a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, that is maintained in a fault-tolerant way. The Dataframe API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD, followed by the Dataset API. In Spark 1.x, the RDD was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the Dataset API is encouraged[3] even though the RDD API is not deprecated. The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API.",
